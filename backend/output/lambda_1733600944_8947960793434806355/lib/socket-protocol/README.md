# SOCKET Protocol

SOCKET Protocol is the first chain-abstraction protocol, enabling developers to build chain-abstracted applications to compose users, accounts and applications across 300+ rollups and chains. Chain-Abstraction is a new computing paradigm for developers, enabling developers to leverage chains as servers/databases, enabling them to reach all users and applications spread across networks while providing a consistent monolithic experience to end users and applications.

SOCKET is a chain-abstraction protocol, not a network(chain/rollup). Using a combination of offchain agents(watchers, transmitters) and onchain contracts(switchboards) it enables application-builders to build truly chain-abstracted protocols.
